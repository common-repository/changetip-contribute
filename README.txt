Recover lost ad revenue and create new revenue streams with ChangeTip Contribute alternatives to paywall and subscription. 

== Description ==

Recover lost ad revenue and create new revenue streams with ChangeTip Contribute alternatives to paywall and subscription. Offer your readers the choice between ads or to pay pennies per page to view your site without ads.

Audience tracking, ad delivery, and revenue are affected by the increasing trend of ad blocking, demand from Millennials for an ad-free user experience, and disruptive tech from Safari and Mozilla. Publishers need alternative solutions for content monetization and direct control of the value exchange with consumers for access to their content.

ChangeTip Contribute offers publishers an alternative to paywall and subscription that allows consumers to only pay for what they consume.  In addition to having a consolidated budget for all paid content, consumers benefit from only having to setup and store their payment information in one account. Additionally, consumers now have the option to contribute to sites they enjoy and still maintain an ad-free experience as an alternative to whitelisting a site in their ad blocker.

Publishers have full control over pricing per page. A penny per page is the equivalent of $10 CPM, and it would be reasonable to require consumers to pay 1-10 cents per page, depending on the value of the content.

== Installation ==

1. Create a site on ChangeTip to connect with WordPress.
1. Designate pricing and settings in ChangeTip.
1. Optional: customize messages in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How much does it cost? =

There are no up front costs. ChangeTip retains 30% of the money earned from paid views. Get 50% off if you start using ChangeTip Contribute in February 2016. Fees waived entirely for the first 3 months if you are one of the first 30 sites to use ChangeTip Contribute.

= Is it a paywall? =

Itâ€™s similar to a paywall, but better. It allows you to offer readers a choice between ads or no ads, and you get paid for content either way. Additionally, readers get to use their paid budget on any site they opt in to pay for a no-ad experience, so they only pay for what they use and gain access to any participating site.

= Does this prevent ad blockers? =

No, it does not yet prevent users from choosing ads and using an ad blocker to block them

= Which ad plugins are supports? =

The first version of ChangeTip Contribute includes support for [AdSense](https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-publisher/). Additional plugins will be available in the future.

If you are accepting funds, you must use the default settings (US dollars). However, readers may pay using US Dollars or bitcoin. Readers may add money to their account using a US debit card or add bitcoin via an external bitcoin wallet or US debit or credit.
